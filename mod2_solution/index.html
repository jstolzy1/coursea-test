      Some common raw toppings include a thin or thick slice of sashimi
      like salmon -Sake, tuna -Maguro, yellowtail -Hamachi, white tuna -Escolar,
      squid -Ika, clams -Hamaguri, whelk -Tsubugai, red snapper -Kurodai, butterflied
      scallop -Hotate, etc. These topping, when used raw usually has an under-coat
      small amount of wasabi. The best nigiri is the one that has bite-size mouthwatering
      sushi rice and thick enough raw topping to complement the flavor. Sushi chefs had
      to spend years of practice before mastering
      the cutting technique and variety flavor/texture nature of each species.
